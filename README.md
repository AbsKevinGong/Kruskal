# Kruskal
In this exercise, you will complete a C++ implementation of Kruskal's MST (min spanning tree) algorithm. 
It consists of 3 modules (files): Edge.h, Kruskal.h, and main.cpp. 
Edge.h contains the definition of an edge object (including the weight associated with the edge). 
Kruskal.h is where the majority of the work needs to be accomplished.
